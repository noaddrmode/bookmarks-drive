# what is rssi variance?

RSSI variance refers to the variation or fluctuation in the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) values observed by a wireless device on a particular Wi-Fi channel. The RSSI value represents the power level of the received signal from the Wi-Fi access point or client device, and is typically measured in dBm (decibels relative to one milliwatt).

RSSI variance can be caused by a variety of factors, such as interference from other Wi-Fi devices, signal attenuation due to distance or obstacles, and reflections or multipath propagation of the signal. In general, a high level of RSSI variance indicates that the wireless signal is unstable or unreliable, which can result in poor Wi-Fi performance, slower data rates, and increased packet loss.

To mitigate RSSI variance, it is often necessary to optimize the placement of Wi-Fi access points and client devices, as well as minimize interference from other wireless devices and sources of signal attenuation. Wi-Fi site surveys, spectrum analysis, and other tools can be used to identify and troubleshoot sources of RSSI variance in a wireless network. Additionally, some Wi-Fi management tools and algorithms, such as Automatic Channel Selection (ACS) and Intelligent Channel Management (ICM), can adjust Wi-Fi channel and power settings in real-time to optimize wireless performance and reduce RSSI variance.

# what is good rssi value?

A good RSSI value can depend on several factors, such as the type of wireless network, the distance between the wireless device and access point, the signal strength and quality of the wireless signal, and the amount of noise and interference present in the wireless environment.

In general, a higher RSSI value indicates a stronger received signal and better wireless performance. For most Wi-Fi networks, a minimum RSSI of around -70 dBm to -80 dBm is generally considered acceptable for basic connectivity, while an RSSI of -60 dBm or higher is considered good, and an RSSI of -40 dBm or lower is considered excellent.

It's important to note that RSSI alone is not always a reliable indicator of wireless performance or signal quality. Other metrics, such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Packet Loss Rate (PLR), and Data Rate, should also be considered when evaluating the performance of a wireless network.

Additionally, it's important to keep in mind that RSSI values can vary depending on the wireless device being used, as well as the vendor-specific implementations of the Wi-Fi chipsets and drivers. Therefore, it's always best to consult the documentation provided by the wireless device manufacturer or vendor for specific recommendations and guidelines regarding RSSI values.

# I mean good rssi variance value
There is no universally agreed-upon threshold for what constitutes a good or acceptable RSSI variance value, as this can depend on several factors such as the specific wireless network environment, the Wi-Fi equipment used, and the desired level of wireless performance.

In general, a lower RSSI variance indicates a more stable and reliable wireless signal, which can lead to better Wi-Fi performance and fewer connectivity issues. However, some level of RSSI variance is to be expected in most wireless environments due to factors such as interference and multipath propagation.

Wi-Fi management tools and algorithms, such as Automatic Channel Selection (ACS) and Intelligent Channel Management (ICM), can help to optimize wireless channel and power settings in real-time to minimize RSSI variance and improve overall Wi-Fi performance. These tools typically use sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques to continuously monitor and analyze the wireless environment, and make adjustments to the Wi-Fi settings as needed to minimize interference and maximize signal quality.

# what is channel load variance?

Channel load variance refers to the variation or fluctuation in the amount of wireless traffic present on a particular Wi-Fi channel over time. It is typically measured as a percentage, and reflects the degree to which the channel is being utilized by wireless devices and applications.

High channel load variance can be problematic for wireless networks, as it can result in congestion, decreased throughput, and increased packet loss. Additionally, it can make it more difficult for Wi-Fi management tools and algorithms, such as Automatic Channel Selection (ACS) and Intelligent Channel Management (ICM), to effectively optimize Wi-Fi channel and power settings.

To mitigate channel load variance, it is often necessary to optimize the placement and configuration of Wi-Fi access points and client devices, as well as prioritize and manage network traffic. Network administrators can also use Wi-Fi monitoring and management tools to monitor channel utilization and performance, and make adjustments to Wi-Fi settings as needed to optimize performance and reduce channel load variance.

# what is OBSS check?

OBSS (Overlapping Basic Service Set) check is a feature of Wi-Fi management and optimization algorithms that is designed to reduce interference and improve overall Wi-Fi performance in environments with multiple Wi-Fi networks.

An OBSS occurs when multiple Wi-Fi access points are operating on the same or overlapping channels within the same physical area, resulting in interference and decreased performance for all networks involved. The OBSS check is designed to detect and mitigate these situations by identifying when two or more Wi-Fi networks are overlapping and taking appropriate action, such as adjusting channel and power settings or restricting access to specific channels.

The OBSS check is typically performed by Wi-Fi management tools and algorithms, such as Automatic Channel Selection (ACS) and Intelligent Channel Management (ICM), which continuously monitor and analyze the wireless environment for signs of interference and congestion. When an OBSS is detected, these tools may recommend or automatically implement changes to the Wi-Fi settings to minimize interference and optimize performance.

OBSS check is an important feature in Wi-Fi management, as it can help to reduce interference and improve Wi-Fi performance, especially in crowded or high-density Wi-Fi environments such as airports, stadiums, and conference centers.

# what is the difference between full ACS check and OBSS check?

Automatic Channel Selection (ACS) is a feature of Wi-Fi management and optimization algorithms that is designed to select the optimal Wi-Fi channel and power settings for an access point based on the characteristics of the wireless environment. There are two types of ACS checks: Full ACS and OBSS check.

Full ACS check is a comprehensive scan of all available channels to find the best Wi-Fi channel for an access point based on a range of criteria such as signal strength, noise, and interference. Full ACS is typically performed during the initial configuration of an access point or after a significant change in the wireless environment.

On the other hand, OBSS (Overlapping Basic Service Set) check is a feature of ACS that specifically looks for overlapping channels between multiple Wi-Fi networks within a given area. When two or more access points are operating on the same or overlapping channels, they can interfere with each other and degrade the performance of both networks. OBSS check is designed to detect these situations and make recommendations for adjusting the Wi-Fi settings to minimize interference and improve overall performance.

In summary, while full ACS and OBSS check are both part of the Automatic Channel Selection process, full ACS is a comprehensive scan of all available channels to find the best channel based on various criteria, while OBSS check specifically looks for overlapping channels between multiple Wi-Fi networks within a given area to reduce interference and improve performance.

# what is limited BSS check?

Limited BSS (Basic Service Set) check is a feature of Wi-Fi management and optimization algorithms that is designed to prevent interference between Wi-Fi access points operating in the same or adjacent physical spaces.

A BSS is a group of one or more Wi-Fi client devices that are associated with a single Wi-Fi access point, and each BSS is assigned a unique BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) to identify it on the network. In a crowded or high-density Wi-Fi environment, multiple access points may be operating in close proximity, and if they are not properly configured, they can interfere with each other and degrade the overall performance of the network.

Limited BSS check is designed to detect when two or more access points are operating on the same or overlapping channels within a certain distance of each other, and take appropriate action to reduce interference and improve overall performance. This may include recommending or automatically implementing changes to the Wi-Fi channel and power settings, or restricting access to specific channels.

Limited BSS check is typically performed by Wi-Fi management tools and algorithms, such as Automatic Channel Selection (ACS) and Intelligent Channel Management (ICM), which continuously monitor and analyze the wireless environment for signs of interference and congestion. When a Limited BSS situation is detected, these tools may recommend or automatically implement changes to the Wi-Fi settings to minimize interference and optimize performance.

In summary, Limited BSS check is a feature of Wi-Fi management and optimization algorithms that is designed to prevent interference between Wi-Fi access points operating in the same or adjacent physical spaces by detecting when two or more access points are operating on the same or overlapping channels and taking appropriate action to reduce interference and improve performance.


# what is antenna polarization?

Antenna polarization is a fundamental property of radio waves and describes the orientation of the electric field vector of an electromagnetic wave as it propagates through space. The electric field vector of a radio wave can be oriented in any direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation, but in most practical applications, the orientation of the antenna is used to define the polarization.

In wireless communication systems, antennas are typically designed to emit or receive radio waves with a specific polarization. The two most common types of polarization are linear polarization and circular polarization.

Linear polarization refers to a radio wave in which the electric field vector oscillates in a single plane, while circular polarization refers to a radio wave in which the electric field vector rotates in a circular pattern as the wave propagates through space.

The choice of antenna polarization depends on the specific application and the physical characteristics of the environment in which the antenna is used. In general, antennas with the same polarization are more effective at transmitting and receiving signals than antennas with different polarizations, since the electric field vectors of the two waves will align and result in stronger signal strength.

For example, in a point-to-point wireless communication link, it is important to ensure that the transmitting and receiving antennas have the same polarization to ensure optimal signal strength and reduce interference. In a multi-antenna system, different antennas may be used with different polarizations to optimize performance in different directions or to minimize interference from other sources.
